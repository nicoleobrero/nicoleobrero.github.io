*This is our first mini-project for our Data Mining and Wrangling class. This was created alongside [Kevin Delgado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevynndelgado/), [Tsoy Hipolito](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pdanielhipolito/), [Julia Las](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julialas/), and [Leonard Limkaichong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonard-limkaichong-31711611a/). We were tasked to wrangle numerous `MS Excel` files and perform exploratory data analysis.*
