*This is our final project for our Deep Learning class in collaboration with  [Elkan Pagobayan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ejmpagobayan/), [Kris Tabong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristoffer-dave-tabong-7183b2a7/) and [Tonichi Edeza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonioedeza/). Findings were shared in an [online public presentation.](https://www.facebook.com/events/1005936706565759/)*

## Summary
The use of articial intelligence and machine learning in law enforcement is nothing
new. In realm of the judiciary, natural language process techniques have been used
to predict the outcomes of judicial decisions. However, the arti cial intelligence
can also be used to augment policework. This can take the form of unmanned
drones, tapping into data generated by the internet of things, and of course image
processing and identi cation. This paper shall focus on the last one as it applies
to the identi cation of shoes based on shoe outsoles. It was found that the use of
convolutional neural networks can successfully identify shoeprints with an accuracy
of up to 97%. In this paper however, we explore the concept of identifying the
brand of a shoe based solely on its print.
