Hi, my name is Nicole and I work as a data analyst/scientist. I hold a Bachelor’s in Industrial Engineering (University of the Philippines) and Master’s degree in Data Science (Asian Institute of Management).

I have 9+ years of local and international experience in analytics, data engineering, and software development, with a proven track record in solving business problems, providing strategic insights, and driving continuous improvement.
