Hi, I'm Nicole and I work as a data analyst/scientist. I hold a Bachelor’s in Industrial Engineering (University of the Philippines) and Master’s degree in Data Science (Asian Institute of Management).

I have 9+ years of local and international experience in analytics, data engineering and software development. Prior to starting my data science journey, I spent 6 years in the insurance industry working for top insurance companies as a software developer/business analyst/reporting analyst.


On my free time, I practice meditation and yoga. I also enjoying travelling, doing arts and crafts, and watching korean dramas. 

Let's connect on LinkedIn or send me an e-mail. Feel free to ask me anything!
