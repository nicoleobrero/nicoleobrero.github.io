Greetings! I'm Nicole, currently engaged as a data analyst/scientist. I earned my Bachelor’s in Industrial Engineering from the University of the Philippines and pursued a Master’s degree in Data Science at the Asian Institute of Management.

With over a decade of diverse experience in analytics, data engineering, and software development both locally and internationally, I bring a wealth of knowledge to my role. Prior to venturing into data science, I dedicated 6 years to the insurance industry, where I served as a software developer, business analyst, and reporting analyst for leading insurance companies.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I devote time to meditation and yoga, fostering a balanced lifestyle. I'm also passionate about travel, engaging in arts and crafts, and indulging in Korean dramas. 

Let's connect on LinkedIn or drop me an e-mail. Feel free to ask me anything!
